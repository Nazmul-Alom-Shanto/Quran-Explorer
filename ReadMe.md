# Quran Explorer

**Developed by: Nazmul Alom Shanto**

Welcome to **Quran Explorer** — a web application designed to deepen understanding and connection with the Holy Quran.

As a **Hafez of the Quran**, I created this tool to apply what I’ve memorized and to truly understand the meaning behind each verse. This project is a step toward making it a daily habit to explore and reflect on the meanings of the Quran.
